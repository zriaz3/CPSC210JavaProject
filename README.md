# **Lost Dog Tracker**

### *Description of my project*

This application would be for finding lost dogs in a particular area. Users would be able to enter information about their lost dogs including a rough location of where and when they were lost and any descriptions about them or pictures. There would also be a feature for entering dogs found in the area and providing possible matches between dogs lost and dogs found by comparing fields provided in the description of the dog. 

The intended target audience is the general public. Anyone who has lost a dog can input their dogs information or anyone who has found a stray dog can input that information. People who have lost dogs would be able to browse through found dogs in the area and search for theirs but there would also be a feature that automatically compares dogs for possible matches. This project interests me because I recently lost 2 of my dogs and an application like this would have made the search a lot easier rather than searching through numerous posts in facebook groups.
